    This is a course devoted to the hottest programming language in recent
    memory. In it, Data Scientists with experience in the field will learn
    the basic constructs in the language, how a typed programming language
    can help them reason about the correctness of their programs, and how
    to use the many frameworks for Big Data processing that leverage Scala\'s
    expressivity.
